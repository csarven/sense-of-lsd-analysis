                        <p property="dcterms:abstract" class="entry-summary">Linked Statistical Data is proliferating across the Web. As more and more statistical datasets become available, the fundamental question on statistical data comparability, i.e., to what extent arbitrary statistical datasets can be faithfully compared, arises. Besides a purely statistical comparability, we are interested in the role that semantics play in the data to be compared. Our hypothesis is that semantic relationships between different components of statistical datasets might have a relationship with their statistical correlation. Our research focuses in studying whether these statistical and semantic relationships influence each other, by comparing correlation of statistical data with their semantic similarity. The ongoing research problem is, hence, to investigate why machines have a difficulty in revealing meaningful correlations or establishing non-coincidental connection between variables in statistical datasets. We describe a fully reproducible pipeline to compare statistical correlation with semantic similarity in arbitrary Linked Statistical Data. We present a use-case using World Bank data expressed as RDF Data Cube, and we highlight important discussion points.</p>

                    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
                    <p><q>There was this American who was afraid of a heart attack and he found out that the Japanese ate very little fat and almost did not drink wine but they had much less heart attacks than the Americans. But on the other hand he also found out that the French eat as much fat as the Americans and they drink much more wine but they also have less heart attacks. So he concluded that what kills you is speaking English</q> [<a href="http://www.open.edu/openlearn/science-maths-technology/mathematics-and-statistics/statistics/the-joy-stats-meaningless-and-meaningful-correlations"></a>]. While computers can helps us to discover strong correlations in large amounts of statistical datasets, whether by chance or through sophisticated methods, humans (or sometimes also known as <em>domain experts</em>) still need to be critical about the results and interpret them appropriately. This implies that we are still very much involved in the process to discover meaningful correlations by filtering through everything that is presented to us.</p>

                    <p>If we could however improve the situation slightly by having machines present us with only <em>useful</em> correlations from a random mass of correlations, then we give more of our attention to what is interesting. Hence, our goal is to set a path towards identifying <strong>why</strong> some variables have a semantic link between them. Before we establish that, our ongoing approach (as outlined in this research and afterwards) will be to refute or cancel out things which may be in disguise for semantic similarity.</p>

                    <p>Therefore, we set our investigation with a workflow to experiment with Linked Statistical Datasets in the <a href="http://270a.info/">270a Cloud</a>. We have first set our hypothesis to uncover the possibility that <em>semantically similar</em> variables or datasets need to incorporate semantically rich information. Then, the question is, what do exceptionally good linkages for variables look like? We start with our null hypothesis by checking to see whether the dataset titles in World Bank indicators can help indicate strong correlations. Our results show that dataset titles by themselves or within a particular topic area is not a good indicator to predict correlations.</p>


                    <h2 id="methodology">Methodology</h2>
                    <p>We first state our research design and hypothesis, then discuss how we employed Linked Statistical Data (LSD) and Semantic Similarity approaches for a workflow in our <em>LSD Sense</em> implementation.</p>

                    <h3 id="research-design">Research design</h3>
                    <p><strong>Research problem</strong>: Why do machines have difficulty in revealing meaningful correlations or establishing non-coincidental connection between variables in statistical datasets? Put another way, how can machines uncover interesting correlations?</p>

                    <p>Over this ongoing investigation, we hope to uncover some of the fundamental components for measuring or declaring semantic similarity between datasets, in order to better predict relevant strong relationships.</p>

                    <h3 id="hypothesis">Hypothesis</h3>
                    <p>Given our research question, we would like to propose a viable research hypothesis, followed by our investigation with the null hypothesis:</p>

                    <p about="[this:#hypothesis-alternative]" typeof="sio:SIO_000284" property="rdfs:label">H&#8321;: If the absence of semantically rich connection between datasets is inadequate to distinguish meaningful relationships, then making relevant information about dataset connectivity will improve predicting dataset correlations by observing their semantic similarity.</p>

                    <p about="[this:#hypothesis-null]" typeof="sio:SIO_000284" property="rdfs:label">H&#8320;: There exists a significant relationship between the semantic similarity of statistical dataset titles and the correlation among those datasets, because dataset titles can indicate rich connectivity.</p>
                    <span about="[this:#variable-semantic-similarity-lsd-titles]" typeof="sio:SIO_000367" property="rdfs:label" content="semantic similarity"></span><span about="[this:#variable-correlation-lsd]" typeof="sio:SIO_000367" property="rdfs:label" content="correlation"></span>

                    <p>We set the significance level to 5% probability.</p>

                    <h3 id="semantic-similarity">Linked Statistical Data and Semantic Similarity</h3>
                    <p>The RDF Data Cube vocabulary does not only allow to express statistical data in a Web exchangeable format, but also to represent the (semantic) links within those statistical data. This ability poses some new interesting research questions around the relationship between the statistical and semantic relatedness of datasets. We are interested in the interplay of statistical correlation of LSD and their semantic similarity, in order to answer questions like: does correlation between statistical datasets imply some kind of semantic relation? Do certain semantic links imply the existence of correlation? We propose a generic workflow for studying whether or not this relation between correlation and similarity holds for arbitrary LSD. We aim at generic correlation and similarity measures, and our workflow enables the use of any correlation and similarity indicators. For the specific goal of this paper, though, we stick to the use of Kendall's correlation coefficient and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) similarity.</p>

                    <h3 id="implementation">Implementation</h3>
                    <p>We have an implementation of the <a href="https://github.com/csarven/lsd-sense">LSD Sense</a> workflow [<a href="#r_"></a>] which can be used to both, reproduce our experiments, as well as run it on new input datasets. With the exception of determining which datasets to inspect, and the system configuration, LSD Sense is automated.</p>

                    <h4>Semantic Similarity</h4>
                    <p>The semantic similarity algorithm is based on a <em>Latent Semantic Index</em> (LSI). We use the dataset titles to check for their similarity. Essentially, LSI puts each dataset title into a cluster. The number of clusters can be adjusted (default to 200). It remains as an open research question as to what it should be. Generally, research has demonstrated that optimal values depend on the size and nature of the dataset. [XXX: Citation here?].</p>

                    <p>Concerning the quality of the dataset titles, it is possible to come across datasets that differ only by one word e.g., <q>male</q>, <q>female</q>. This potentially lowers the accuracy to differentiate datasets. As mentioned earlier, we removed the attribute information from the dataset titles with the assumption that it reduced noise.</p>

                    <p>We use <a href="http://radimrehurek.com/gensim/index.html">gensim</a> [<a href="#r_"></a>] in our own implementation, <a href="https://github.com/albertmeronyo/SemanticCorrelation">Semantic Correlation</a> [<a href="#r_"></a>] for LSD Sense.</p>

                    <h2 id="experiment">Experiment</h2>
                    <div about="[this:#experiment]" typeof="http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_000994">
                        <p>Two experiments were conducted using the same workflow. Experiments differed only by their input data. In the first experiment, the analysis was done for a particular reference year over all available datasets. In the second experiment, however, we restricted the data further for only a particular dataset domain (topic), thereby making it possible to compare whether a control over a topic can be significant for semantic similarity of the dataset titles.</p>

                        <h3 id="data-requirements">Data Requirements</h3>
                            <p>We decided to conduct our experiment on a simple dataset structure, containing two dimensions; <em>reference area</em>, and <em>reference period</em>, and one measure <em>value</em> for its observations, where the World Bank indicators was a good candidate from the <a href="http://270a.info/">270a Cloud</a> [<a href="#r_"></a>]. The rationale for using only one dataspace (at this time) was to remain within a consistent classification space to measure semantic similarity. We fixed the reference period to 2012, and datasets that are part of <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/education">World Bank's education topic</a>. There was one minor downside concerning the data quality i.e., the attribute/unit information was incorporated as part of the dataset title, usually as a suffix within brackets. We dealt with this by removing the attribute information from the titles as part of preprocessing in the semantic similarity phase.</p>

                        <h3 id="experiment-workflow-world-bank">World Bank Indicators workflow</h3>
                        <p>The workflow of our experiment is summarized as follows:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Correlations for each dataset pair</strong>: We retrieved the 2013 World Bank Indicators datasets, 3267 in total, via SPARQL queries from the <a href="http://worldbank.270a.info/">World Bank linked dataspace</a>. The correlations were computed using R, the statistical software, by joining each dataset pair by their reference area (one of the dimensions of the dataset structure), and using their measure values for the correlation coefficient. Based on preliminary inspection for normality distribution on sample datasets, we noted that observations did not come from a bivariate normal distribution. Hence, we computed Kendall's rank correlation coefficient in our analysis. Initially we computed and stored the correlations for dataset pairs with a sample size, n&gt;10, resulting in 2126912 correlation values. The information on the analysis we generated consisted of the following headers: <code>datasetX</code>, <code>datasetY</code>, <code>correlation</code>, <code>pValue</code>, <code>n</code>, where <code>datasetX</code> and <code>datasetY</code> are the identifiers for each dataset pair that is being compared. We later filtered sample values, n&lt;50, for our threshold for significance. The population size i.e., the number of potential reference areas that can have an observation is 260. That is the number of reference area codes in the World Bank classification, however, it is not known as to which reference areas may occur in a given dataset before hand. We retained majority of the computations in any case, giving us with the possibility to do better pruning in the future, in light of more information.</li>

                            <li><strong>Semantic similarity for each dataset pair</strong>: Before doing the semantic similarity, we first took an unique list of the dataset identifiers from datasetX and datasetY so that what is to be checked for their similarity is only in relation to those datasets, as opposed to the complete set of datasets which we originally retrieved. At this point, we have 2200 unique datasets. The similarity was measured based on dataset titles. They are in short sentences e.g., <q>Mortality rate, infant (per 1,000 live births)</q>. After minor preprocessing e.g., removal of the text pertaining the unit within brackets, it was left with the essence of the dataset title e.g., <q>Mortality rate, infant</q>. The semantic similarity algorithm is based on <em>Latent Semantic Analysis</em> (LSA) [<a href="#r_43">14</a>]. Essentially LSA puts each dataset title into a cluster (default number is 200). The resulting headers of the output was: <code>datasetX</code>, <code>datasetY</code>, <code>similarity</code>.</li>

                            <li><strong>Correlation analysis with variables semantic similarity and correlation of dataset pairs</strong>: We then took the absolute values for both variables; <code>&#x7c;similarity&#x7c;</code>, <code>&#x7c;correlation&#x7c;</code> (caring only for the strength of the relationships as opposed to their directionality). We then filtered both similarity and correlation values &lt;0.05 and &gt;0.95, as well as correlation values with <em>p</em>-value&gt;0.05, for reasons to exclude potential outliers, or misleading <q>perfect</q> relations, as well as to exclude insignificant correlations. The final correlation and scatter plot was generated by joining the similarity and correlation tables on datasetX and datasetY columns. Finally the correlation of the final data table was conducted using the Kendall method as the data had a non-normal distribution and we were interested in modeling (line fitting).</li>

                        <p>The second experiment followed the same procedure for the analysis, but considering only the datasets associated with the topic education for the same reference period.</p>

                    <p><a href="http://csarven.ca/linked-statistical-data-analysis">Linked Statistical Data Analysis</a> [<a href=""></a>], explores a way to reuse statistical linked dataspaces, federated queries, and generation of statistical analyses e.g., regression, for humans and machines. By storing computed analysis, it makes it possible for future discovery.</p>

                    <p><a href="http://www.hicss.hawaii.edu/hicss_46/bp46/hc6.pdf">Towards Next Generation Health Data Exploration</a>: A Data Cube-based Investigation into Population Statistics for Tobacco [<a href="#r_12">12</a>], presents the <a href="http://orion.tw.rpi.edu/~jimmccusker/qb.js/">qb.js</a> [<a href="#r_13">13</a>] tool to explore data that is expressed as RDF Data Cubes. It is designed to formulate and explore hypotheses. Under the hood, it makes a SPARQL query to an endpoint which contains the data that it analyzes.</p>

                    <p><a href="http://www.ke.tu-darmstadt.de/bibtex/attachments/single/310">Generating Possible Interpretations for Statistics from Linked Open Data</a> [<a href="#r_19">19</a>] talks about the Explain-a-LOD tool which focuses on generating hypotheses that explain statistics. It has a configuration to compare two variables, and then provides possible interpretations of the correlation analysis for users to review.</p>

                    <p><a href="http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-41338-4_16">Using Linked Data to Evaluate the Impact of Research and Development in Europe</a>: A Structural Equation Model [<a href="#r_"></a>], presents the feasibility of combining different LOD sources to assess the impact of one variable over others.</p>

                    <p><a href="http://tylervigen.com/">Spurious Correlations</a> [<a href="#r_"></a>] reveals correlations that are not genuine for practical use. In other words, the correlations are type I errors. It emphasizes on the importance for humans to be critical of random correlations, and to investigate whether there is a direct relation between the variables.</p>

		            <p><a href="http://www.ontologymatching.org/publications.html">Ontology Matching</a> is perhaps the most mature field in the Semantic Web dealing with the general problem of &#8220;finding semantically related entities of ontologies&#8221; and Linked Data [<a href="#r_44">16</a>], although resources like WordNet and DBpedia are also related.</p>

		            <p>Unfortunately, there is hardly any research support providing an integrated study on how semantic relatedness may enhance meaningful statistical data comparisons.</p>
